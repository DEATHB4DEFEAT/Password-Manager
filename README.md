# Free local password manager

This is a free password manager I made that stores data locally because my mom was annoyed at how many different accounts data she needed to store.

## Installation

To install the needed dependencies open the `install.bat` file located in the main folder.
After the command prompt closes you should be ready to go.

## Execution

To run the app open the `start.bat` file after installing dependencies. (I reccommend maximized window)

You can find all available commands and how to use them by typing either `help` or just pressing enter.

## Features

- 100% reliable security
  - No online interactions ever occur within this project. (except for npm installation)
  - No entry data is being sent anywhere except the `src/data` folder,
- Only source code
  - You can edit the code how you please, just don't cry to me about issues you make.
  - You can verify the security of this project yourself if you would like.
  - I have no idea how to make javascript executables.
- Easy to use
  - All commands and usage listed inside the help command
  - Note: never add any extra words other than the command until you get another prompt or the app will crash.
