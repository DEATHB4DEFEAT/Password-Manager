# Local Password Manager

This is a password manager I made that stores data locally because my mom was annoyed at how many different accounts data she needed to store.

## Installation

To install the needed dependencies open the `install.bat` file located in the main folder.
After the command prompt closes you should be ready to go.

## Execution

To run the app open the `start.bat` file after installing dependencies. (I recommend maximized window)

You can find all available commands and how to use them by typing either `help` or just pressing enter.
